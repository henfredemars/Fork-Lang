# Fork-Lang
Compiler and Runtime development repo for the Fork Programming Language.

Not to be confused with any extant language, Fork is an experimental 
langauge (under development) emphasizing concurrency in the language 
grammar.

For more information, contact a contributor and inquire about a formal 
specification. This will be migrated here in time.

Depends: flex, GNU bison, make
